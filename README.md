# Note Taker Starter Code# Beck-Note-Taking-App

# Description 
The Beck-Note-Taking-App is an easy to use, express note taking application that allows users to create, save, and delete titled notes with as much detailed information as they need. 

Users can set reminders for upcoming  dentist appointments, notes for class, or log in progress for hobbies like weightlifting or financial budgets. Check the screenshots below for some of these examples in the app, or click the link and create your own notes! 

# Acceptance Criteria 

This app meets the user acceptance criteria by displaying the landing page when the user enters the live server. The landing page says "Note Taker" with an icon of a pencil and paper, that reads below "Take notes with Express" and a blue "Get started" button. 

When the user clicks the button, it sends a request to the server which takes them to a page where they can now add notes for anything they wish, which will then be saved to their local storage once the user presses the save button in the right hand corner. 

Existing notes will be saved in the left column, these can also be deleted by clicking the trashcan icon on the right side of each note. Users can also clear a note if they decide to delete it before choosing to save.
